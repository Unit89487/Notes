Read -> Eval -> Print 


 Decimal has ten possible values for a single digit. Ternary, for example, has three possible values. Binary, two, and so on. Octal has eight. Hexidecimal has sixteen possible values. 
 
**Learning Tip** - the more modes you absorb something in, the more it is reinforced in long term memory. For example writing, typing, hearing it spoken, speaking it yourself, seeing it visually, etc. etc. 


**CPU** 


**Memory**
Primary memory - RAM.
Secondary memory - Storage. Disk. SSD. DVDs. Orders of magnitude slower, but much, much larger. 

**I/O**
Peripherals 
Mice, keyboards,
Output: sounds, mitty, video, printing, rendering text on the screen. Anything rendering on the screen is considered video. 




**Email publisher** page 17 should be "64 bits", which is an 8-byte and should be called double or long word.
