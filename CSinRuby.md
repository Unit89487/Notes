## Chapter 1 Exercises 

1) 

a. number_to_square = gets 
    number_squared = number_to_square * number_to_square 
    

b. base = gets
    exponent = gets
    result = base * u
    
2) 

a. 

for (n = 1, n <= 100; counter++)
if (n == 1)
	n =+ n;
else 
	n =+ n + 1 

b. 



3) word = "anna"
    if each character of word is equal to each character of word.reverse at the same index, the word is a palindrome. 
    

4) 
if (opening)
	enter opening
if (wall) 
 	left !wall ?  turn left and go : turn right and go
  

5) 

a. The figure represents an algorithm for returning the proper change to a customer. 

b. If change due (C) is more than or equal to a dollar, give the customer one dollar and subtract a dollar from change due. Look at change due again, if it is still greater than or equal to one dollar, repeat the first step. If it is less than a dollar, and is greater than or equal to one quarter, give the customer one quarter and subtract that quarter from C. Repeat until C is no longer greater than or equal to one penny. 

6)

The engineer's algorithm "exits prematurely." As long as all the houses are connected, the engineer's algorithm exits, meaning that there is a chance the algorithm will connect all the houses and stop looking before the cheapest route has been found.

3) 9, 511, 056 bytes

1 Gigabyte; or closer to 10 megabytes 

4) 

Rate of transfer = 1 000 000 bits per second 

720 * 600 pixels = 2160 * 1800 bytes = 3 888 000 bytes = 31 104 000 bits 

Transferring a single frame would take thirty seconds. 

31 104 000 * 25 = 777 600 000 bits per second 

778 seconds 

There's no way someone is going to be able to stream this movie without experiencing jittery playback. In fact, there wouldn't be much playback to speak of.
