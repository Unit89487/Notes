## Chapter 1 Exercises 

1) 

a. number_to_square = gets 
    number_squared = number_to_square * number_to_square 
    

b. base = gets
    exponent = gets
    result = base * exponent 
    
2) 

a. 

for (n = 1, n <= 100; counter++)
if (n == 1)
	n =+ n;
else 
	n =+ n - 1 

b. 



3) word = "anna"
    if each character of word is equal to each character of word.reverse at the same index, the word is a palindrome. 
    

4) 
if (opening)
	enter opening
if (wall) 
 	left!wall ?  turn left and go : turn right and go
  

5) 

a. The figure represents an algorithm for returning the proper change to a customer. 

b. If change due (C) is more than or equal to a dollar, give the customer one dollar and subtract a dollar from change due. Look at change due again, if it is still greater than or equal to one dollar, repeat the first step. If it is less than a dollar, and is greater than or equal to one quarter, give the customer one quarter and subtract that quarter from C. Repeat until C is no longer greater than or equal to one penny. 

6)

The engineer's algorithm "exits prematurely." As long as all the houses are connected, the engineer's algorithm exits, meaning that there is a chance the algorithm will connect all the houses and stop looking before the cheapest route has been found.
