## Fundamental Geometric Concepts

Just like building a house, we cannot start out with the walls or the roof. We've got to start out with the foundations.  We will start  out with the basic ideas of helping you try to visualize the relationships of points and lines and planes in space. How they create angles, and then triangles, and other polygons and on into the circles. We'll eventually go from the two-dimensional construct to the three-dimensional constructs. 



**Points** are represented by dots.  A point technically has no dimension - it has 0 dimensions. It's not even a defined term, it's just an intuitive idea. The dot is not a point - it just represents the invisible point. 

Beginning with these points, we'll expand on into lines, planes and space. 

* ***Postulates*** or ***Axioms*** are statements we accept as being true. 
* ***Theorems*** must be proven before being accepted as true. 
With these two things together, we can evolve other ideas, adn then prove them by previously learned theorems, axioms and ideas. 
* A ***Corollary*** is basically a spin-off from another theorem. They are very similar to theorems and in this course, we consider all corollaries theorems. 






***Postulate 1 - 1*** Given any two points, there is a unique distance between them.

---.-----------.---->  if these two points are O and N. L = ON   =  NO    

Lines never stop. They go out infinitely far. 

Points can be collinear if they lie on the very same line. 

Lines can intersect. Either they intersect **obliquely**, at anything other than a right angle, or **perpendicular**, at a right angle. The third form lines can take is called **skew** lines, where they never intersect and they're not parallel either. 

A **plane** is like a line in that it is infinite. We need to chop it off some place to see the region we want to deal with. If there are points A, B, C in the plane we can just call the plane ABC. Or we can call it one capital letter, like plane M for example. If A, B, and C reside on the plane then the plane is said to **contain** those points. If there are point D and E are above or below the plane, they are not contained in the plane.
Lines can be in the plane, lines can intersect the plane, or they can be parallel to the plane. 

The next dimension is **space**. Two planes can be parallel to each other in space. One plane above the other. They can be parallel, and they can intersect. There's no such thing as skew planes. If you extend them far enough and they're not parallel, they will eventually intersect. Two planes can 

**Space** technically is the set of all points. It is all inclusive. It contains all points and lines and planes. We live in a three-dimensional world so we can understand everything three d and less. We can understand one-dimensional things and 0-dimensional ideas like points. 

### Lines 
Let's tale a line with four collinear points. <---A---B----C----D---> 
AB = AC = AD = BC = BD = CD (you can also flip the letters as in AB = BA)

<---A---B----C--->

ray BA->  & Ray BC->  go in opposite directions. 

line segment AB-- starts and stops. 

**Congruent** is an all-inclusive word meaning it's the same geometric shape, size, everything. 

***P 1-2*** Any segment has exactly one midpoint. A-------M-------B

***T 1-1*** The midpoint theorem. 2AM = AB   ;   2MB = AB  ;  AM = [1/2]AB   ;   MB = [1/2]AB   


A segment can be bisected not only by a point, but also by a line. 

H----A----M   (picture two horizontal lines bisecting HM by intersecting at the point. There could even be a plane slicing through the midpoint.)


***P 1-3***

1. Any two distinct points on a line can be assigned coordinates 0 and 1. 
2. There is a one-to-one correspondence between the real numbers and all points on a line.
3. The distance between two distinct points of the line is the absolute value of the difference of their coordinates. 
 
***P 1-4*** "Segment Addition Postulate" If C is between A and B, then AC + CB = AB
